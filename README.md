> by [Wren Hawthorne](https://github.com/wrenhawth)

## Overview

This is my submission for the Fetch Front-End Take Home Exercise. The most recent version is hosted on vercel and can be viewed [here](https://fetch-take-home-wren-hawthorne.vercel.app/)

### Highlights

* The app will display in light mode or dark mode depending on the [user's system preferences](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
* Users are able to sort by age, breed, and name
* Search results are displayed in a responsive grid

### Architecture

* Built using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework for app-based routing
* [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) component library was used to speed up development
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility classes were used for styling

## Running locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
